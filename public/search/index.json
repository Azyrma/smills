Manning, P. Raghavan and H. Schütze can be found here. Personally, I found it quite useful if you want a different view / explanation on the topics discussed in the lectures, but it is not required for passing the course.\nExercises There are weekly quizzes and Jupyter Notebooks that you may solve as an exercise. I would recommend to do the weekly quizzes at least, since they will give you the most benefit for the exam.\nBonus points There is an opportunity to receive bonus points, up to 0.25, which will count towards your final grade. The bonus consists of three of the weekly quizzes, from which you will need to get the required points from two of them, on the dates specified below:\n21.03 Tolerant Retrieval 18.04 Index Compression 02.05 Vector Space Model It is possible to pass the quizzes without solving the Jupyter-Notebook, but I would recommend to solve it in the week with the bonuses. The time limit for each quiz is one week, you have one attempt.\nSlides Date Keyword(s) Slides Extras 28.02 Introduction - - 07.03 Boolean Retrieval infret_week2 Kahoot 14.03 Term Vocabulary infret_week3 Kahoot Photo: Poppy field near Vétheuil by Claude Monet, ca. 1879\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","image":"http://localhost:1313/p/infret/poppies_monet_hu_39f82cab0bf667cd.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/infret/","title":"Information Retrieval - FS25"}]
