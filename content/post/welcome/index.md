I am a fourth semester BSc student and I am currently a teaching assistant in Information Retrieval and also a Board Member in [VIS](vis.ethz.ch). Apart from ETH, I like to go skiing, trail-running and play video games. Don't ask me how I have time for all of this (I don't).

Feel free to reach out to me, whether it's about my exercise sessions (feedback is much appreciated), ETH, VIS, life or anything else, really. You can usually find me in oVIS (CAB E 31) as well.
